**Hangman Game**
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game.

**Overview**
The **hangman.py** script is a text-based game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word, and the player wins by correctly identifying all the letters in the word before running out of guesses.

**Features**
**Random Word Selection:** The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
**Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Depending on the word length or number of attempts allowed, the game can be adjusted for different difficulty levels.
**Visual Feedback:** The game displays the word with blanks for unguessed letters and provides feedback on incorrect guesses.
**Replayability:** After each game, the player is given the option to play again.

**How to Play**
Run the **hangman.py** script.
The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters in the randomly selected word.
Enter a letter to guess.
If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If incorrect, it counts as a wrong guess.
Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

**Running the Game**
To play the game, simply execute the hangman.py script using Python.
